This project implements a microservice-based calculator using Node.js and Express.js. It provides API endpoints for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and includes error handling and logging using Winston. 2. Tools & Technologies Used Node.js

Express.js (Node.js framework for API development)

Winston Logger (Logging library)

Git & GitHub (Version control and repository hosting)

Visual Studio Code (Code editor)

setup & Installation

Install Dependencies Ensure Node.js is installed, then run: npm init -y
npm install express winston
Create server.js
Start the Server 2. node server.js
Logging Errors: logs/error.log
All logs: logs/combined.log

4. Code Structure
Main Files
server.js → Contains API logic for arithmetic operations.

logs/ → Stores logs generated by Winston.

package.json → Manages dependencies and scripts.

1. Overview
This microservice extends a basic calculator by introducing advanced arithmetic operations, including:

Exponentiation (num1^num2)

Square root (√num)

Modulo (num1 % num2)

It also incorporates logging with Winston and error-handling strategies to improve reliability and debugging.

Project Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/nouman392/sit737-2025-prac4p.git
cd sit737-2025-prac4p

Running the Microservice
To start the microservice, run:
node server.js

Error Handling Strategies Used
The microservice applies three error-handling strategies:

Input Validation: Ensures input numbers are valid before processing.

Logging with Winston: Logs errors and operations for better debugging.

Graceful Error Responses: Returns meaningful error messages instead of crashes.

 Conclusion
This project expands the basic calculator microservice by adding advanced operations, logging, and error handling. It demonstrates how to build a robust, scalable microservice using Node.js and Express.
